# Bernie WP Theme

## Description

This theme and repo are a tutorial project that roughly follows along with the [Wordpress Theme Handbook.](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/)

## Structure

The repo is structured into branches that correspond more or less to sections of the handbook. Generally, branches get fleshed out as the numbers go up. The branches:

  1. Theme Structure
   
   This branch follows the Core Concepts section of the handbook. Most of them are blank and only here for illustration of the structure. I removed patterns/example.php and added minimal info to theme.json because having those blank threw errors.

   2. Minimal template parts

  This branch adds enough to template parts to make pages and posts render. The handbook goes into theme.json next but I need to have things onscreen before I can style them.

  3. Global Settings

  This branch roughly follows the Global Settings and Styles section of the handbook.
